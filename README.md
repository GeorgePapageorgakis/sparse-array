#### sparse-array
A simple implementation of sparse array as linked list is an array 
in which most of the elements have the default value (usually 0 or null). 
The occurrence of zero-value elements in a large array is inefficient for 
both computation and storage. An array in which there is a large number of 
zero elements is referred to as being sparse.
